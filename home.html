            <h2>You & Me</h2>
            <p class="section-text">We met around the end of february, I remember you texted me to play some games, and I said yes. I remember I was so happy because I'm always the one reaching out to others. I thought you were cool! I never pretended anything I'm always so happy to talk to new people and you were really nice to me. I told you my real age and acted like I act with an irl friend... cos I usually tell people I am 1 year older because I was born at the end of the year.
                I started questionning myself about my sexuality at some point because I became kinda obsessed with the thought of you, even though I had a boyfriend. I realised I was falling in love a few weeks after and thought I would loose my chance if I decided too late, so I broke up and asked you out the second after. Was it an impulsive decision?  Probably... but I don't regret.
                Yeah! We made it to one year.
                We learned about each other and tried to make things better with the high and lows and moreover we fought the distance between us, until november 2023 when we met each other. It was for a short time but I remember every single details and It was one of the most peaceful hours of my life, where I could feel safe. There are a lot of pros and cons but at the end... dont we love each other?</p>
