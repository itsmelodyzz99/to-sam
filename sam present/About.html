            <h2>What makes you Sam</h2>
            <p class="section-text"> You are so pretty and caught my eye when I saw you... Love at first sight? we did rush things, but don't you think it was written? I'm glad I met you... you made me feel a different love and safety 
                and I can say today that I really fell for you. You're a special person to me and you changed me a lot. I wish to stay with you forever cos I don't think I will be able to replace you
                It may not be the same for you but I see you as a confident a best friend and a girlfriend even tho it doesnt go as it could go because of the distance... you're my everything, probably because I have no one else.
                I admire your smartness and your determination for certain things. Your way of handling certain situation. And now that met you I can say that you're hotter irl than on you pictures, and very cute.
                Please Let's try more and build something bigger and better for both of us...
