            <h2>My thoughts</h2>
            <p class="section-text">I love you and I hate that you could do anything but I would still come back to you, cos I'm such a fool and so in love. I'm not perfect and I feel bad about a lot of things.
                About my clinginess and my overthinking, about not giving you the love you need as a person who needs physical touch. An what I hate the most is that I am sure it could go well
                if we lived close to each other ... I hate that you are the one for who I could do anything cos I gave up on my life ... but you are not here . And you are the one who keeps me up everyday.
                and for who I fight the most everyday... I love you. Yeah I am probably crying while typing this and you are probably feeling sad while reading it. Love hurts, we all know that. But I am not ready to give up on this how long it will take. I know you gave up on yourself
                But don't give up on me... please... I need you. Mel </p>
